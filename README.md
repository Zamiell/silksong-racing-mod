# The Silksong Racing Mod

This is a [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://hollowknightsilksong.com/) mod that removes most of the painful waiting in the game. It is designed as a quality of life mod for people wanting to practice the game casually or for racing each other in a head-to-head speedrun.

Under the hood, it uses the [BepInExPack for Silksong](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong/) to hook C# functions and [Silksong.FsmUtil](https://github.com/silksong-modding/Silksong.FsmUtil) to edit FSM logic.

## Features

### In-Game Features

#### Skip Cutscenes

This is the main feature of the mod. Many things in the game are sped up or removed:

- The opening cutscene is removed. (New games start with Hornet lying on the ground.)
- The "bind cutscene" that teaches you how to bind at the beginning of the game is replaced with the normal "wake up" animation. (This is the animation that would play if you saved and quit and reloaded the game after watching the bind cutscene.)
- NPCs:
  - The Chapel Maid conversation is skipped (by setting `churchKeeperIntro` to true).
  - The initial Shakra conversation is skipped (by setting `metMapper` to true).

  - The Moss Mother roar that is part of her introduction sequence is skipped.
